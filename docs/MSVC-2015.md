## MSVC 2015 SP3 Compatibility

StaticMode is compatible with MSVC 2015 SP3 (this is currently the main
development target). All tests and examples build and run correctly.
However there is a compiler bug with one use of `decltype` that you
might encounter in your own code.

The use of `decltype` in the example in README.md works fine.

The compiler bug prevents the use of `decltype` for specifying the
type of template function parameters, which results in a
`error C2062 type 'unknown-type' unexpected` error. A workaround is to
create a separate type alias, and use it in the template function declaration
instead of using `decltype` in the function declaration.

Here is an example of the workaround:
